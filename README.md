# 🌀 3-Trial-Mass Rotor Balancing Calculator

A simple and interactive web-based tool designed to calculate **correction mass**, **placement angle**, and **expected residual vibrations** (radial, axial, and horizontal) for rotor balancing using the **3-Trial-Mass Method**.  

This method is widely used for balancing **fans, blowers, motors, and industrial rotors** in steel and process plants. The app performs complex vector calculations to determine the exact correction parameters and can run **fully offline** in any modern browser.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Input trial mass and vibration data at 0°, 120°, and 240°.  
- Compute exact correction mass (kg) and placement angle (°).  
- Estimate residual vibration after correction.  
- Works offline; mobile and desktop friendly.  
- Simple, intuitive interface for field use.  

## 💡 Applications
- Industrial fans and blowers  
- Motor and pump rotors  
- Coke plant and steel plant DE fans  
- Rotating shafts and impellers
